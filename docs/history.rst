0.3.5 (2020-10-25)
------------------

Optimised how nbqa passes files so that pre-commit hooks run faster.

0.3.4 (2020-10-23)
------------------

Fixed bug whereby nbqa was giving the wrong error message when running ``nbqa doctest`` and
the notebook contained a library which couldn't be imported.

0.3.3 (2020-10-21)
------------------

More precise error diagnostics if code-quality tool isn't found (thanks Girish Pasupathy!).
You can now install all supported code-quality tools with ``python -m pip install -U nbqa[toolchain]`` (thanks Sebastian Weigand!).
We handle a greater array of cell magics by default.
We removed ``nbqa-doctest`` pre-commit hook, as this one's best run from the command line (thanks Sebastian Weigand!).

0.3.2 (2020-10-17)
------------------

In-built pre-commit hooks for `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `isort`, `pyupgrade`, `doctest`, and `pylint` are
now available.

0.3.1 (2020-10-16)
------------------

Fixed bug whereby `nbqa` was using the system (or virtual environment) Python, rather than
the Python used to install `nbqa`. This was causing issues when running `nbqa` outside of a
virtual environment.

0.3.0 (2020-10-12)
------------------

Added support for `pylint` (thanks Girish Pasupathy!).
Fixed a false-positive in `black` when cells ended with trailing semicolons.
Fixed some false-positives in `flake8` regarding expected numbers of newlines.

0.2.3 (2020-10-06)
------------------

Output from third-party tools is more consistent with the path the user passes in. E.g.
if the user passes a relative path, the output will show a relative path, whilst if the
user passes an absolute path, the output will show an absolute path.
Users are also now encouraged to report bugs if there are errors parsing / reconstructing
notebooks.

0.2.2 (2020-10-01)
------------------

Optimised handling cell-magics and improved support for indented in-line magics (thanks Girish Pasupathy!).

0.2.1 (2020-09-27)
------------------

Fix bug in which cells with trailing semicolons followed by empty newlines were having semicolons added to the newline.
Added support for ``pyupgrade``.

0.2.0 (2020-09-26)
------------------

First somewhat stable release, with ``flake8``, ``black``, ``isort``, ``mypy``, and ``doctest`` supported, and configuration via ``pyproject.toml``.
